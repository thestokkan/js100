// In the exercises for the previous chapter, you wrote a dynamic greeter program
// named greeter.js. Add a function to this program that solicits the user's first
// and last names in separate invocations; the function should return the
// appropriate name as a string. Use the return values to greet the user with
// their full name.

function getName(prompt) {
  let read = require('readline-sync');
  return read.question(prompt);
}

firstName = getName("What is your first name? ");
lastName = getName("What is your last name? ");

console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
